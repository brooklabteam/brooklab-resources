# Adding a University of Chicago Supplier

1.	Go to https://services.uchicago.edu/
2. Select Services portal
3. Select Purchasing/Payment/Procurement
4. Select Supplier Set-up or Modify
5. Select "Request this Service"
6.	Login with CNet ID
7.	Fill out form. You will need:
- Your information (name, department)
- Name/email of anyone you want copied on request (add Bonnie Brown, brownbj and Cara Brook, cbrook)
- Supplier information (name, contact*, phone). *This is who the request will be sent to so make sure it’s an email that will get answered!
- If your supplier is a foreign supplier, please have them fill out the W8BEN tax form linked [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8bene.pdf) and attach it to the request.
8. Submit


A ticket will be created for your submission, and you’ll be assigned a case worker for the ticket. The case worker will reach out to the contact you provided to ask them to fill out payment/tax forms. You will get emails updating you on progress and can check the status of your ticket from the services website.

The whole process is typically quick (can be less than 1 week). You will hear back from your case worker within 1-2 business days when they open your ticket. The longest portion is typically getting the supplier contact to fill out the necessary documents—I recommend emailing them in advance to make sure they know the request will be coming. Once the forms are complete, approval takes 1-2 days.
