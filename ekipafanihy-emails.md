# Making an ekipafanihy.org email account

1. You will need a personal gmail account.  This will be the email where all of your ekipafanihy.org emails forward. If you do not have one, please make one and share with Benjamin and Cara.
2. Once you have shared and they give you the go-ahead with the username for this new email (typically firstname.lastname@ekipafanihy.org), please go to settings in your gmail account to which this will forward.
3. Select "Accounts and Import", then "Send mail as", "Add another email address"
3. Type your name and your ekipa email address (e.g. firstname.lastname@ekipafanihy.org) and hit "Next step".
4. In the next window, under SMTP Server, type "smtp.gmail.com". Under Username, type your gmail address before the @ symbol (for example, I would type cbrook04), then leave on default as TLS, port 587.
5. For the password in this window, you need to separately go to accounts.google.com and under "Privacy" make an App password. You should choose "Other" for the App and type ekipafanihy as the name. Then copy and paste this password into the password window in step #4 and hit "Add account."
6. From there, you should have a drop down menu in gmail where you can send mail as your default gmail or your new ekipa address.
