# Submitting a University ePayment Invoice for Payment

1.	Follow the directions [here](https://finserv.uchicago.edu/sites/finserv.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Documents/pdf/ePayment%20Request%20QRC.pdf) under 'How do I submit it a request?'

2. In the "General Comments" box at the bottom of first screen in ePayment, you need to enter the wire transfer information (e.g. which account to use for the wire transfer). This will be written as "Department account for wire transfer fee: XXX", where you enter the FAS account number and the subaccount code 4901 for wire transfer fees here.

3. In addition to the actual invoice, you need to attach the wire transfer form. The forms are available [here for domestic](https://finserv.uchicago.edu/sites/finserv.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Documents/pdf/wire_transfer_domestic_1.pdf) and [here for international](https://finserv.uchicago.edu/sites/finserv.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Documents/pdf/wire_transfer_international.pdf).

4. If you are in the Brook lab, you can go to our lab Box folder to view an example invoice from Bonnie [here](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/1359149553401?s=q9ftz4wduv8itvwoai5fx5v1sshr87b7) or an example video walkthrough of the process [here](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/1359178103282). Additionally, if this is an invoice to Association Ekipa Fanihy, you can access the filled-in international wire transfer form form a previous transaction to just edit for this one [here](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/1359166879130).
